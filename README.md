## How To Use

This application was developed using the Axia Solution local web service API. I've altered the source code to render it static.
These simple steps are available.

1. When the application is opened, the user is required to authenticate. For the demonstration user: email: `user`, password: `123`.

2. The user would have access to the projects for which he is responsible and to all the purchase and sale invoices of his company.

3. Lastly, it is possible to change the tasks in a project.
